which purchasing model and service tier is to be selected

        DTU: basic, 
             standard: (DTU?; data max size?)
             premium: (DTU?; data max size?)
        
        read scale out: azure creates replica for intensive read quries: when we query: 
                            it get info from secondary database; to reduce the io.
        
        vcore: general purpose: (facility to choose the hardware and vcore ) compute tier: provisioned/ 
                                                                                          serverless 
                                                                                               - (per second charge / use when there is an unpredictable load )
                                                                                               - active for 2 hrs like that timeframe when there is high traffic
                                                                                               - autopause delay:  when there is no traffic in  period of one hour then its automatically inactive
               hyperscale: supports upto 100TB
                           can create upto 4 secondary replica (can use for disaster recovery or read intensive queries
               business critical: can enable or disable the read replica and there is no charge for it.


azure deployment models:
     1. single database:
          whatever allocated cpu, memory dedicated to that database only.
          isolated and portable

     2. elastic pool database:
          collection of databases
          shared set of resources
          cost effective solutions
          unpredictable usage pattern
     3. managed instance:

     * sql elastic pool: 
          creation:
                resource group name: 
                elastic pool name: 
                db server:
                compute+storage: 
                     poolsetting:  eDTU
                     databases:
                     per database settings:
          create database:
               name:
               backup storage redundancy: locally/ Geo

               we can create multiple database based upon requirements

     * active geo replication in azure sql database:
          allows us to create multiple readonly secondary copies in a region or different region
          we can create for readable secondary single database or set of databases in elastic pool
          create upto 4 replicas in same or different regions

          create:
               resource group:
               database name:
               db server:
                         name:
                         login name:
                         login password:
                         location:
               compute+storage: 
               
               geo replication:
                    target region:
                    by default: it is readable for secondary
                    target server:
                         name:  secondary server
                         login username 
                         password:
                         location:


disaster recovery:
     automatic database backups
     active geo replication: database level configuration
      autofailover groups: server level configuration
               failover group name:
               server: select the secondary server
                    name:
                    login name:
                    password:
                    location:
               readwrite fail over policy: automatic/manual
               read/write grace period: minimum one hour
